I'm a senior compute architect at NVIDIA, focused on accelerating Deep Learning software stack on cutting-edge GPUs such as Hopper, Blackwell and Rubin. 

Currently, I am engaged in developing a deep learning compiler and enhancing end-to-end training performance. My research interests span compiler optimization, high-performance computing, and AI systems. I work on pushing state-of-the-art deep learning models to industry-leading performance.

In my spare time, I maintain a keen interest in emerging deep learning algorithms, including embodied AI, AI4Science, LLM and AI4Graphics.
